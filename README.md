 # Color-Based-Product-Prediction
Developed a web application that predicts products based on their colors using a machine learning model. The application is built using Flask (backend), Bootstrap (frontend), and Python for model development and integration.

Used For 
VS Code 
------------------------
Step 1 :   window -> Open Command Prompt -> install this packages ,
           pip install opencv-python numpy pandas scikit-learn ,
           pip install flask ,
           pip install opencv-python opencv-python-headless opencv-contrib-python ,
------------------------
Step 2 :
Download all these files; they will be used. ☝️☝️☝️😀 (The files mentioned above are correct.)
---------------------
Color_prediction.py ,
flask_2.py ,
rgb.csv ,
index_color.html 
---------------------

-----------------------------------------

Data Collection: Images or videos with labeled colors and products.
Data Preprocessing: Resize, normalize, or convert images to a specific format.
Model Building: Use models like:
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) if using images.
Model Training: Train your model on the dataset.
Model Evaluation: Check accuracy and performance.
Model Deployment: Deploy the trained model using Flask.
